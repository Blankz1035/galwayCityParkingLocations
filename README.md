## Introduction to My Project

This project provides the design and documentation for the datasets "Galway City Parking Locations"
which is available at https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-car-parking-locations
The data that is being used in this dataset is only data that has been put together for Galway county itself. I would suggest to the dot.gov authority to include datasets for all major cities in Ireland, let alone the world.

The target audience for people using this app would be people who are travelling the country and are looking for places to leave their vehicle and also targeting the people in the region to show more awareness of other parking locations in their area.
